		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FOIA Data Upload Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the FOIA data upload interface into component-level subtasks covering file upload UI, parsing logic, column mapping interface, validation, and Supabase integration",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple technologies (React, file parsing, Supabase) but leverages existing infrastructure. Well-defined requirements with clear technical specifications."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Multi-Tiered Address Matching System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the address matching system into algorithm-specific subtasks for exact matching, normalization, fuzzy matching, confidence scoring, database integration, and performance optimization",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple matching algorithms, performance requirements with 701k records, and need for accuracy tuning. Requires sophisticated algorithm implementation and database optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create FOIA Property Filtering System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the filtering system into API extension, database indexing, React filter components, and state management subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity building on existing search infrastructure. Performance requirements are critical but system architecture is established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Data Validation and Conflict Resolution Tools",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down validation tools into validation rules engine, conflict resolution interface, quality metrics dashboard, audit trail system, and rollback functionality",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity requiring business rule implementation, UI for conflict resolution, and data integrity features. Multiple interconnected components with quality assurance focus."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Property Search Interface with FOIA Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the search interface enhancement into results table modification, filter integration, property detail modal, and mobile responsiveness subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity extending existing UI components. Well-defined requirements with established patterns to follow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Interactive Map with FOIA Visualization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down map visualization into marker enhancement, clustering optimization, popup implementation, filtering controls, and performance optimization for large datasets",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to performance optimization needs with 701k parcels, map clustering algorithms, and interactive features. Builds on existing Mapbox integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create User Authentication and Role Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose authentication system into Supabase Auth setup, role definition and RLS policies, login/registration UI, user management interface, and session management",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving security considerations and RLS policies. Leverages existing Supabase infrastructure but requires careful security implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Property Assignment and Progress Tracking System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split assignment system into database schema design, assignment interface, status tracking, team dashboard, and notification system subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity with database design, UI components, and notification systems. Requires integration with existing user system and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Analytics Dashboard for Property and Team Insights",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down analytics dashboard into materialized views creation, chart implementation, real-time updates, and export functionality subtasks",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving database optimization, charting libraries, and real-time features. Performance requirements with large dataset need careful consideration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose testing and documentation into unit testing, integration testing, E2E testing, documentation updates, API documentation, and CI/CD setup subtasks",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive coverage requirements across all previous tasks, performance benchmarking needs, and integration with existing systems. Dependencies on all other tasks make this particularly complex."
